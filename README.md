Money-Heist: 2-Player Video Game

## What is it?
The purpose of this project was to create a two-player game where the user-controlled characters must work together in order to collect all the keys and bring them back to the vault before the time runs out. This game was created in C# using the Visual Studio 2015 IDE and the XNA Framework.

## How To Play
This game has been designed using object-oriented programming concepts, and is simple and fun to play. The players can control their characters using an Xbox controller or a laptop/PC keyboard. The UI/UX interface is clean and has been created in a way that is fun to interact with.
